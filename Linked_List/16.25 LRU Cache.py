LRU Cache: Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item.
The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associÂ­ ated
with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full,
it should evict the least recently used item.

"""
From Leet code

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair 
to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
Follow up:
Could you do get and put in O(1) time complexity?
